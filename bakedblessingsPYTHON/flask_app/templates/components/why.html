    <div class="flex flex-col gap-3">
        <p>As a fulltime wife and homeschool mom of two young boys, and a former classroom teacher, I understand how exhausting life can be and how providing my family with homemade baked goods can seem like a distant dream. With the skill I had acquired from baking for my family and friends, it just seemed logical to share my love for baking with my community to help fill a need and a desire for homemade baked goods despite a busy schedule. Using the sourdough starter I acquired from a friend here in the Wenatchee Valley, I have expanded my repertoire from loaves of bread to English muffins, pizza crust, and cinnamon rolls, all using Sourdough as the key ingredient.</p>
        <p>I have had many people ask me why I decided to use Sourdough starter as the key ingredient for my baked goods. The first aspect of Sourdough that intrigued me was the fact that my friends who are gluten intolerant and usually don't eat "normal" wheat flour bread, were not bothered by the gluten in Sourdough bread. This is because of the fermentation process the starter goes through before being added to the wheat flour to make the bread. The fermentation breaks down the gluten in the flour making it more digestible. Over the years I have baked with almond and coconut flour in order to provide treats for my gluten intolerant friends, but the texture is always different from "regular flour". With Sourdough starter I can bake goodies that use wheat flour, keep the texture that most people know and love, and not worry about gluten intolerance.</p>
